Welcome to Breakout++!

In this classic arcade-inspired game, your goal
is to break all bricks on the screen with
a bouncing ball and a paddle. Use arrow keys to
move your paddle and keep the ball in play.

If you miss the ball and it goes off the bottom
of the screen, you will lose a life.
You have three lives to start with, but you can
earn more by reaching certain scores.

There are also power-ups hidden in some of the
bricks that can give you extra abilities. Some
power-ups can bring nerfs and make the game more
difficult! Make sure to watch out for them.

The game has a total of 4 levels. New levels are
unlocked when the previous level is cleared.
The game ends when you've beaten all levels or
lost all of your lives.

Good luck!                                Next ->
