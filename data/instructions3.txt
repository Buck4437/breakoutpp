Notes                                       (4/4)
-------------------------------------------------
Thank you for taking time to read this section!
We hope you enjoy the game.

Remember, in the game, your goal is to destroy
blocks and gain points. To achieve this, you'll
need to make fast reponses and good decisions on
using the special attack skill.

If you achieve a top 10 score (on your local
device), you will get into the leaderboard!

To prevent weird graphic display, you are advised
not to resize the terminal during the gameplay.

Good luck, and have fun!
